# NVIM Claude

Sends selected text to the Anthropic API via [https://github.com/scossar/nvim_conversation_manager](https://github.com/scossar/nvim_conversation_manager). The response is appended to the current buffer.

Only intended to be used with markdown files.

It's a basic plugin. I made it for my own use.
